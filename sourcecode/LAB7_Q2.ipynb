Brin in 2003\\\\nGoogle began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in Stanford, California.\\', \\'[18] The project initially involved an unofficial \"third founder\", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;[19][20] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.\\', \\'[21][22]\\\\nWhile conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.\\', \"[23] They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website\\'s relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.\", \"[24][25] Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page\\'s ideas.\", \\'[19]\\\\nPage and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine \"BackRub\", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.\\', \\'[26][27][28] Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google.\\', \\'Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998.\\', \\'HÃ©ctor GarcÃ\\\\xada-Molina and Jeff Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project.\\', \"[29] PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page\\'s PageRank patent including a citation to Li\\'s earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu.\", \\'[30][31][32]\\\\nEventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine originated from a misspelling of the word \"googol\",[33][34] the number 1 followed by 100 zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.\\', \"[35]\\\\n\\\\n Google\\'s original homepage had a simple design because the company founders had little experience in HTML, the markup language used for designing web pages.\", \\'[36]\\\\nThe domain name www.google.com was registered on September 15, 1997,[37] and the company was incorporated on September 4, 1998.\\', \\'It was based in the garage of a friend (Susan Wojcicki[18]) in Menlo Park, California.\\', \\'Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.\\', \\'[18][38][39]\\\\nGoogle was initially funded by an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems; the money was given before Google was incorporated.\\', \\'[40] Google received money from three other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, Stanford University computer science professor David Cheriton, and entrepreneur Ram Shriram.\\', \\'[41] Between these initial investors, friends, and family Google raised around 1 million dollars, which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California.\\', \\'[42]\\\\nAfter some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[41] a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[43] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital.\\', \\'[40]\\\\n\\\\nGrowth\\\\nIn March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California,[44] which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.\\', \"[45] The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin\\'s initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine.\", \\'[46][18] To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.\\', \\'[47] In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo!, one of the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi.\\', \"[48][49]\\\\n\\\\n Google\\'s first production server.\", \\'[50]\\\\nIn 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an office complex from Silicon Graphics, at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California.\\', \\'[51] The complex became known as the Googleplex, a play on the word googolplex, the number one followed by a googol zeroes.\\', \\'Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319Â\\\\xa0million.\\', \\'[52] By that time, the name \"Google\" had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb \"google\" to be added to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary, denoted as: \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet\".\\', \"[53][54] Additionally, in 2001 Google\\'s Investors felt the need to have a strong internal management, and they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as the Chairman and CEO of Google [55]\\\\n\\\\nInitial public offering\\\\nGoogle\\'s initial public offering (IPO) took place five years later, on August 19, 2004.\", \\'At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024.\\', \\'[56] At IPO, the company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.\\', \\'[57][58] Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, underwriters for the deal.\\', \\'[59][60] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.\\', \\'[61]\\\\n\\\\n Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011\\\\nIn October 2006, Google announced that it had acquired the video-sharing site YouTube for $1.65Â\\\\xa0billion in Google stock,[62][63] and the deal was finalized on November 13, 2006.\\', \\'[64][65] On April 13, 2007, Google reached an agreement to acquire DoubleClick for $3.1Â\\\\xa0billion, transferring to Google valuable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and advertising agencies.\\', \\'[66]\\\\nIn 2005, The Washington Post reported on a 700 percent increase in third-quarter profit for Google, largely thanks to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet.\\', \\'[67] In May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed one billion for the first time.\\', \\'[68] By 2011, Google was handling approximately 3 billion searches per day.\\', \\'To handle this workload, Google built 11 data centers around the world with some several thousand servers in each.\\', \\'These data centers allowed Google to handle the ever changing workload more efficiently.\\', \"[55]\\\\nOn August 15, 2011, Google made its largest-ever acquisition to date when it announced that it would acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5Â\\\\xa0billion[69][70] This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola\\'s considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,[71] mainly Apple and Microsoft,[72] and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android.\", \\'[73]\\\\n\\\\n2012 onward\\\\nThe year 2012 was the first time that Google generated $50 billion in annual revenue, generating $38 billion the previous year.\\', \\'In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, \"We ended 2012 with a strong quarter ...\\', \\'Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter.\\', \\'And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year â\\\\x80\\\\x93 not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half.\\', \\'\"[74]\\\\nIn June 2013, Google acquired Waze, a $966 million deal.\\', \"[75] While Waze would remain an independent entity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly
